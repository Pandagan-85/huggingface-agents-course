    "### What is GAIA?\n",
    "\n",
    "GAIA is a benchmark designed to evaluate AI assistants on real-world tasks that require a combination of core capabilities‚Äîsuch as reasoning, multimodal understanding, web browsing, and proficient tool use.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was introduced in the paper ‚Äù[GAIA: A Benchmark for General AI Assistants](https://huggingface.co/papers/2311.12983)‚Äù.\n",
    "\n",
    "The benchmark features 466 carefully curated questions that are conceptually simple for humans, yet remarkably challenging for current AI systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate the gap:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Humans: ~92% success rate\n",
    "- GPT-4 with plugins: ~15%\n",
    "- Deep Research (OpenAI): 67.36% on the validation set\n",
    "\n",
    "GAIA highlights the current limitations of AI models and provides a rigorous benchmark to evaluate progress toward truly general-purpose AI assistants.\n",
    "### üå± GAIA‚Äôs Core Principles\n",
    "GAIA is carefully designed around the following pillars:\n",
    "\n",
    "- üîç Real-world difficulty: Tasks require multi-step reasoning, multimodal understanding, and tool interaction.\n",
    "- üßæ Human interpretability: Despite their difficulty for AI, tasks remain conceptually simple and easy to follow for humans.\n",
    "- üõ°Ô∏è Non-gameability: Correct answers demand full task execution, making brute-forcing ineffective.\n",
    "- üß∞ Simplicity of evaluation: Answers are concise, factual, and unambiguous‚Äîideal for benchmarking.\n",
    " \n",
    "### Difficulty Levels\n",
    "GAIA tasks are organized into three levels of increasing complexity, each testing specific skills:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Level 1: Requires less than 5 steps and minimal tool usage.\n",
    "- Level 2: Involves more complex reasoning and coordination between multiple tools and 5-10 steps.\n",
    "- Level 3: Demands long-term planning and advanced integration of various tools.\n",

    "\n",
    "> Which of the fruits shown in the 2008 painting ‚ÄúEmbroidery from Uzbekistan‚Äù were served as part of the October 1949 breakfast menu for the ocean liner that was later used as a floating prop for the film ‚ÄúThe Last Voyage‚Äù? Give the items as a comma-separated list, ordering them in clockwise order based on their arrangement in the painting starting from the 12 o‚Äôclock position. Use the plural form of each fruit.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, this question challenges AI systems in several ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Requires a structured response format\n",
    "- Involves multimodal reasoning (e.g., analyzing images)\n",
    "- Demands multi-hop retrieval of interdependent facts:\n",
    "    -Identifying the fruits in the painting\n",
    "    -Discovering which ocean liner was used in The Last Voyage\n",
    "    -Looking up the breakfast menu from October 1949 for that ship\n",
    "- Needs correct sequencing and high-level planning to solve in the right order\n",
    "\n",
    "This kind of task highlights where standalone LLMs often fall short, making GAIA an ideal benchmark for agent-based systems that can reason, retrieve, and execute over multiple steps and modalities.- \n",

    "\n",
    "For this Unit, we created an API that will allow you to get the questions, and send your answers for scoring. Here is a summary of the routes (see the live documentation for interactive details):\n",
    "\n",
    "- GET /questions: Retrieve the full list of filtered evaluation questions.\n",
    "- GET /random-question: Fetch a single random question from the list.\n",
    "- GET /files/{task_id}: Download a specific file associated with a given task ID.\n",
    "- POST /submit: Submit agent answers, calculate the score, and update the leaderboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "The submit function will compare the answer to the ground truth in an EXACT MATCH manner, hence prompt it well ! The GAIA team shared a prompting example for your agent [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/gaia-benchmark/leaderboard) (for the sake of this course, make sure you don‚Äôt include the text ‚ÄúFINAL ANSWER‚Äù in your submission, just make your agent reply with the answer and nothing else).\n",
    "\n",
    "## üé® Make the Template Your Own!\n",
    "\n",
    "To demonstrate the process of interacting with the API, we‚Äôve included a [basic template](https://huggingface.co/spaces/agents-course/Final_Assignment_Template) as a starting point.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please feel free‚Äîand actively encouraged‚Äîto change, add to, or completely restructure it! Modify it in any way that best suits your approach and creativity.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to submit this templates compute 3 things needed by the API :\n",
    "\n",
    "- Username: Your Hugging Face username (here obtained via Gradio login), which is used to identify your submission.\n",
    "- Code Link (agent_code): the URL linking to your Hugging Face Space code (.../tree/main) for verification purposes, so please keep your space public.\n",
    "- Answers (answers): The list of responses ({\"task_id\": ..., \"submitted_answer\": ...}) generated by your Agent for scoring.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence we encourage you to start by duplicating this [template](https://huggingface.co/spaces/agents-course/Final_Assignment_Template) on your own huggingface profile.\n",

    "## üèÜ Check out the leaderboard [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/agents-course/Students_leaderboard)\n",
    "\n",
    "A friendly note: This leaderboard is meant for fun! We know it‚Äôs possible to submit scores without full verification. If we see too many high scores posted without a public link to back them up, we might need to review, adjust, or remove some entries to keep the leaderboard useful. The leaderboard will show the link to your space code-base, since this leaderboard is for students only, please keep your space public if you get a score you‚Äôre proud of.\n",
